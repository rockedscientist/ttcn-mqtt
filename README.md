# ttcn-mqtt

This repository contains the source code used for studying the compliance levels of three different open source MQTT brokers.

------

It contains self-developed code in the *MQTT_Test.ttcn* file which was inspired by the example given by Elemer Lelik in the Eclipse Titan Community forums: <https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1085301/> and relevant modules required to run the TTCN-3 tests.

[Eclipse Titan](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.titan) version 6.2.0 is required to successfully compile and run the experiments.
